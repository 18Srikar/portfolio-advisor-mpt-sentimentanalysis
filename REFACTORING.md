# Project Refactoring and Technical Debt Reduction

This document outlines the refactoring work performed to reduce technical debt and improve code quality in the Investment Portfolio Generator project.

## Files Removed

- **src/utils/mock_data.py**: Completely removed mock data fallbacks in favor of proper error handling and reliable API operations with caching and retry logic.

## Major Refactoring

### 1. data_service.py

- **Added abstractions**: Created helper methods like `_check_cache`, `_validate_symbols` to reduce code duplication
- **Consolidated ETF handling**: Created a generic `get_etfs_by_category` method to handle both bond and gold ETFs
- **Improved error handling**: Standardized error responses to return empty structures instead of mock data
- **Type annotations**: Enhanced type hints throughout the file
- **Retry mechanism**: Refined the retry logic with exponential backoff for API rate limiting

### 2. app.py

- **Separation of concerns**: Split large functions into smaller, focused ones
- **Function extraction**: Moved business logic out of route handlers into separate functions
- **Service initialization**: Created dedicated functions for initializing services with proper error handling
- **Improved error handling**: Standardized error responses and added input validation
- **Configuration management**: Better organization of environment variables and configuration settings
- **Logging improvements**: Enhanced logging with more consistent message format

### 3. Test Suite

- **Renamed test file**: Changed from `test_changes.py` to `test_data_service.py` for clarity
- **Enhanced test coverage**: Added unit tests for key data service functionality
- **Mocking**: Added proper mocks for external services to enable isolated testing
- **Test structure**: Converted to proper unittest framework with setup/teardown

## Added Documentation

- **README.md**: Comprehensive documentation of project structure, features, and setup
- **REFACTORING.md**: This document detailing refactoring work
- **requirements.txt**: Updated with specific version requirements

## Code Quality Improvements

1. **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**: Eliminated duplicate code in data service
2. **Single Responsibility Principle**: Functions and methods now have clear, single responsibilities
3. **Consistent error handling**: Standardized approach to error handling across the codebase
4. **Improved testability**: Better separation of concerns makes the code more testable
5. **Enhanced type annotations**: More comprehensive type hints for better IDE support and bug prevention
6. **Better naming**: More descriptive variable and function names

## Benefits

- **Reduced maintenance burden**: Simplified codebase with less duplication
- **Improved reliability**: Better error handling and retry logic
- **Enhanced performance**: More efficient caching with entry-level expiration
- **Better developer experience**: Clearer code organization and better documentation
- **Easier onboarding**: New developers can understand the codebase more quickly
