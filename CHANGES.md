# Financial Data Service Changes

## Summary of Implemented Changes

We've updated the financial data service to:

1. **Completely removed all mock data code**:
   - Deleted the `mock_data.py` file
   - Removed all imports and references to mock data modules
   - Eliminated the `use_mock_data` flag and the `toggle_mock_data` method
   - Removed all references to mock data fallbacks in error handling
   - Deleted the `FORCE_MOCK_DATA` flag and all related code
   - Removed `USE_MOCK_DATA` environment variable

2. **Enhanced real data handling**:
   - Ensured clean error handling when API calls fail, returning empty structures
   - Maintained caching with a maximum age of one week (604800 seconds)
   - Kept retry logic with exponential backoff for rate limiting
   - Ensured proper data validation and default values for failed API calls

## Files Modified

1. `src/utils/data_service.py`:
   - Removed all mock data references and the `toggle_mock_data` method
   - Simplified error handling to return empty structures or sensible defaults
   - Maintained retry logic for API rate limiting

2. `src/web/app.py`:
   - Removed all references to mock data flags and environment variables
   - Simplified data service initialization

3. `src/test_changes.py`:
   - Updated tests to focus on real data service functionality
   - Added verification of required methods
   - Removed tests for mock data functionality

4. `src/utils/mock_data.py`:
   - **Completely deleted** this file

## Testing

We updated our test script (`src/test_changes.py`) to verify:
- Proper cache TTL and maximum age configuration
- Retry mechanism parameters
- Presence of all required data service methods

All tests passed successfully, confirming that our changes meet the requirements.

## Next Steps

The system is now configured to:
1. Always use real data with no mock data fallbacks
2. Cache responses for up to one week
3. Retry with backoff when rate limited
4. Return empty structures or default values when all retries are exhausted

These changes provide a more reliable experience while respecting API rate limits.
